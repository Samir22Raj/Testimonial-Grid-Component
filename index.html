						“ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
						needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
						programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
						student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
						program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
						were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
						agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
						learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
						have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
						example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
						job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
						recommend! ”
